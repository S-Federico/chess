# Chess
CLI chess game for testing gameplay mechanics of our game using Stockfish as an ai agent to play against, in a modified version of chess.

```bash
pip install flask stockfish
```

The tests seem to show the modification to the gameplay make Stockfish easily beaten, so it doesn't fit our use case.
